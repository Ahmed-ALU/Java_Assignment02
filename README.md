# Java_Assignment02
This repository contains the codes of the second assignment for the course "Database Systems" in my year two at The African Leadership University in Rwanda.

### The prompts is as the following:

Instructions

1. This assignment will be done on individual basis
2. The expected submission will be a zipped file which has source codes for each question. 
3. Each question will be graded according to the rubric
4. The rubric and the questions are complementing each other not contradicting.
5. Do not copy any work, you might seek thoughts and clarification either from the facilitators or from peers but not copying other people's work.

Qn1.

Given a number, the program will process it and print its reverse. The program will be generic in a sense that it can accept any number from the user instead of a pre-defined value. For example, if the input inputs 12345, the output should be 54321.

Qn2.

Write a program that generates a random number between 0 and 30, and asks the user to guess what the number is (by typing the number they have guessed).

If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again.

" If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again."

The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number and display matched. The program shall equally display the number of attempts.
